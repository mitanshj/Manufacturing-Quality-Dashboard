# Manufacturing Quality Control Dashboard

A Python-based tool to automate the quality control process for manufactured parts. This project simulates reading production data, analyzing it against quality tolerances, and generating a visual dashboard of the results.

## Demo / Output

Here are the summary charts generated by the analysis script:

![Bar Chart of Quality Status](https://github.com/mitanshj/Manufacturing-Quality-Dashboard/blob/main/quality_bar_chart.png?raw=true)

## Features

- **Data Simulation:** Includes a script (`create_data.py`) to generate a realistic sample dataset (`.csv`) of manufactured bolt diameters.
- **Data Analysis:** Reads the production data using the Pandas library and classifies each part as 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' based on defined engineering tolerances.
- **Reporting:** Prints a summary of the quality check directly to the console.
- **Visualization:** Generates and saves a pie chart and a bar chart using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a clear visual summary of the production quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Setup and Usage

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/mitanshj/Manufacturing-Quality-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/mitanshj/Manufacturing-Quality-Dashboard.git)
    cd Manufacturing-Quality-Dashboard
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the scripts:**
    First, generate the sample data:
    ```sh
    python create_data.py
    ```
    Then, run the analysis to generate the charts:
    ```sh
    python analyze_data.py
    ```
    The output charts (`quality_pie_chart.png` and `quality_bar_chart.png`) will be saved in the project folder.

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to apply my Python skills to a problem related to my mechanical engineering background. I gained hands-on experience with:
- Data handling and analysis using the Pandas library.
- Creating professional data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Setting up a complete Python project environment.
- The full Git & GitHub workflow, from local commits to pushing a final project online.
